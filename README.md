# JCreate

A simple pure Java no-dependencies Wrapper around maven to allow me to forget the weird command syntax.


## Features

- Project Creation
- Help Message

Comming soon:
- Dependency management


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Jotrorox/JCreate
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd JCreate
```

Build and package it into a jar

```bash
  mvn clean jar
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  mvn clean test
```

You probably never need to run tests locally, if you are not developing,
since Tests are run on every commit or push.
